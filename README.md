# Attiny85-button1
Control an LED with a button on an attiny85

If you want to try it out yourself, download the .hex file and then flash it onto your ATTiny85.
If you want to check out the code written in AVR assembly, check out the .asm file.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Put an LED onto PB3, and a button onto PB4.
Then just flash the hex file that I provided you in this git.
